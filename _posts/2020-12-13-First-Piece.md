# Hi, there!

> 千里之行，始于足下。

One of my favourite sayings of all time is this: "The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to him his own.[1]" A similar saying also exists in the old Chinese saying as “授人以鱼不如授人以渔”. The question now is how can one reveal himself of his own riches, even with the help of others?

With the explosion of technologies since last century, expotential growth is now a blessing to some but maybe a doom to others. For example, we may all feel overwhelming at school or work when faced with dozens of tasks that seem exhausting to finish from time to time. However, when the navigation app on our phones makes it much easier and convenient than ever before to show us the directions on the go, we are enjoying the benefits of overall technology development.
